## Assignment 3

#### Technical issues: 
The signature file did not match the installer hash. Had to change the "4.4.0" to "4.4.1" in this url: https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-4.4.0-signed.msi.sha256  
Other than that there were no problems.

My map-reduce operation is useful because you can see how much money is spent on specific days, dated.
