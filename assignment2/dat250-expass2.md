## DAT250 - Assignment 2

I had no technical difficulties when installing and using JPA, other than some problems with Lombok. I had not installed Lombok on Eclipse IDE, only downloaded the jar.
This was easily fixed by simply installing the lombok with an easy command in cmd.

I inspected the databases using cmd and following the instructions on the derby web page.
