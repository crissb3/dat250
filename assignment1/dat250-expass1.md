# Dat250 Report for assignment 1

1. There were few to none problems installing the software required for this course. I am not too familiar with environment variables, paths and such,
so I had to do some googling and reading to make sure I did everything right. This was not a big problem and did not take too much searching to find answers for.

2. I made sure everything worked by following tutorials where I was not 100% sure of what had to be done. I am familiar with IntelliJ and know that this is working
as it should. 

3. For the Heroku platform and tutorial I came across a few problems on the way, but none that was not easily fixed by doing some research online.
    Some of the problems I encountered were I had some syntax errors that I could not find after copy/pasting the code from the tutorial to the pom.xml file,
      but luckily I was able to find it quite early so I was never stuck for long.
      Another "problem" was with the PostgreSQL installation where I couldn't get it to work with Heroku, even after adding the paths and installing it correctly.
      I solved this by adding the correct paths (bin and lib). I had added the wrong paths at first.
